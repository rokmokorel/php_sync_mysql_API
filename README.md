# php_sync_mysql_API

<h2>Sync data between MySQL tables.</h2>
<p>Imagine having a main table that contains a data about a product and prices for this product for different
regions. Then we have couple of support(sub) tables in which we want to store data about the product with prices for a
specific region. With this API solution, we are able to transfer data from main table into the supporting tables</p>

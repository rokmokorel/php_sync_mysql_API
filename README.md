# php_sync_mysql_API

<h2>Sync data between MySQL tables.</h2>
<p>Imagine having main table that contains data about a product and prices of this product for different
regions. <br>In addition we have couple of support(sub) tables in which we want to store data about the product with prices for a
specific region. <br>With this API solution, we are able to transfer data from main table into the supporting tables</p>
